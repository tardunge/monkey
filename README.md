[Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) is a programming language that you can build yourself by reading through [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/).

Implementing the monkeylang is fun and especially in Go is more fun. Heavily inspired by the books mentioned above.
